## VISUALIZING CONNECTIONS
# | Nadieh Bremer at Eyeo 2019 |

In this talk Nadieh reveals the (sometimes ugly) truth behind the design process of several interactive data visualizations from personal projects to client work. The common thread they all share; they all tell a story about connections, but in completely different ways. From a royal family tree, to those existing between UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, to connections drawn in the night skies and more. All types connections are unique and revealing the intricacies that lie within them requires a creative, iterative and custom approach. 

Nadieh Bremer is a graduated Astronomer, turned Data Scientist, turned Data Visualization Designer, based near Amsterdam. After working for a consultancy & fintech company where she discovered her passion for the visualization of data, she's now working as a freelancing data visualization designer under the name "Visual Cinnamon". 

As 2017's "Best Individual" in the Information is Beautiful Awards, she focuses on uniquely crafted (interactive) data visualizations that both engage and enlighten its audience. Ranging from companies as extensive as Google News Lab and UNESCO to small start-ups. From printed magazines such as Scientific American to an interactive experience for the Guardian to more promotionally focused artful visualizations for press releases, data-driven reports, and data art for in the office. As long as there's data that has a story to reveal.
