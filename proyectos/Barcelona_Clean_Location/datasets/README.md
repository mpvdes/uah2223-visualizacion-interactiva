History

Inside Airbnb was founded by Murray Cox, an artist, activist and technologist who conceived the project, compiled and analyzed the data and built the site.

John Morris, designer and artist, designed and directed the user experience.
Acknowledgments:

    The early seeds of the project were sparked while Murray was working with Clarisa James, the Executive Director from DIVAS for Social Justice over the summer of 2014, where he co-taught youth of Central Brooklyn about gentrification in Bedford-Stuyvesant using mapping, data and visualization. He also experienced the impact of community maps on the public with the students' work on exhibition at Weeksville Heritage Centre during Creative Time's Black Radical Brooklyn exhibition.
    The Ellis Act Evictions by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project provided inspiration about about how community housing issues could be mapped.
    Window into Airbnb's hidden impact on S.F. by Carolyn Said from the San Francisco Chronicle was insightful about Airbnb's role in the community and led to questions about what information was available in New York City.
    Jason Clampet of Skift wrote an article Airbnb in NYC: The Real Numbers Behind the Sharing Story which had some great data and statistics, yet offered a challenge to take it further.
    Veralyn Williams and Mark Winston Griffith, community organizers and investigative journalists from the Brooklyn Movement Center / Brooklyn Deep provided some early feedback, advice and a neighborhood perspective of how Airbnb was being used in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights, as well as the impact of Airbnb on legitimately licensed Bed and Breakfasts like the Akwaaba Mansion in Bedford-Stuyvesant (which is proudly People of Color owned).
    Noel Hidalgo from Beta NYC, a civic hacking organization, provided enthusiasm and encouragement, and others from the Beta NYC community responded to technical questions.
    Dennis George, the Principal of George Architect with information about the zoning laws of New York State.
    Paula Z. Segal, Esq. from Mohen and Segal / 596 Acres offered inspiration with her own community mapping and open data projects, and helped talk through some aspects of the project.
    The following friends and supporters provided invaluable feedback and testing:- Samantha Box, Jason Brathwaite, Chris Carter, Andrew Cox, Juny E. François, Esq., Mark Winston Griffith, Noel Hidalgo, Chris Hwong, Clarisa James, Harvir Kaur, Joanne Miguel, Nicole Salzano, Paul Smullen and Veralyn Williams.
    The Get the DATA button was made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.
    John Morris donated many hours of his wordly skills, and is a good friend and gentleman. He also schooled me on American English grammar.
    Last, but not least, Samantha Box provided support during the many hours of coding and analysis, and helped resolve key questions about the issues, data and how best to tell the story. She also provided Christmas cake, doubles and mean Sazeracs.
