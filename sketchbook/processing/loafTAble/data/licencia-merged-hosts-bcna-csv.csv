My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip!

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local.

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local.

My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

Gracias, Damien & Team.

I like to provide a simple and stress-free alternative to staying in a hotel, but with all the facilities that make a hotel relaxing and fun to stay in.

My name is Javier, and although I'm originally from Girona, I've been living in Barcelona for the past 25 years, so I know the city and its surroundings quite well.
 
Traveling is one of my favourites hobbies. I love getting to know different cultures and people from around the world. I had the chance to visit many countries, either for fun or for professional reasons, since my last job was as a publisher for trade magazines.
 
I started the business of rental apartments “The Vintage Rentals”  because as a tourist, I lived first hand the benefits of living a local experience wherever I go, and I know other people search the same type of authentic vacations. This is how I got into the this business and now I have apartments in the best areas of Barcelona with all the necessary facilities for an affordable price.

Back then I was 25 years old. I stayed for 10 days and that was enough for me to fall in love with this amazing city. After this trip, I returned to my home country (Germany), packed my bags, made the necessary arrangements, and relocated to Barcelona 4 weeks later. I was only living in my new destination for one week when a local apartment owner asked me if I might know people in Germany who would like to visit Barcelona and rent her apartment for their holiday. And I did. A friendly gesture later turned into a business. Today I own and manage a small and exclusive selection of holiday rentals in Barcelona center. So far, I had the opportunity to host guests from all over the planet; Alaska to Oman, Island to Abu Dhabi, and from everywhere in between. What a great experience. I still remember my first days in Barcelona and therefore understand well how especially first-time visitors feel. There is so much to discover and it gives me great pleasure to not only provide a safe and comfortable place to stay for my guests but also share the rich culture of this unique place. Food, wine, history, and local people are just amazing.

I'm from Barcelona; as were my  parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, as far back as I remember! I am a lover of my city, but of the original city of Barcelona, the whole gothic and Eixample area is spectacular!

I worked previously in communication and creativity, but for some time now I decided to use all my creativity in creating furniture and decoration. Restore anything that people do not want as they think it is useless or old or broken, I look for new uses for them so that they don’t die and remain among us.

I am delighted and 100% available to give directions and suggestions about my city! Here I´ll give you the first, advice... watch your bag! Catalans are very good people, but we also have one or two thieves…well, many actually !
 
I hope you ll feel at home in my apartment and enjoy very much the city!

See you soon!!

I also like a lot to travel and I have already been lodged in houses rented in Paris and in Prague (my two favorite European cities, apart from Barcelona, of course) this experience has led me also to share my house with other travelers as you. The philosophy of Airbnb has seemed very interesting to me since the moment that I knew it.
If you have any doubt, ask me and like this you will already prepare better your journey.

I am sure that I will make you increase your taste for Barcelona: restaurants, calm and shaken places, museums, monuments, charming corners, beaches, port, etc. And all what goes with your tastes. And if it is not like this, I will invite you to a bottle of Catalan cava.

Ah! And I comply with the settings!

Until soon!

Under Archsense Apartments and ArchSense Barcelona brands, we are a young and dynamic company that is dedicated to personalized management of tourist apartments and houses in two diferent areas in Spain. In Barcelona  (Catalunya) and Pontevedra (Galicia).

Our management comprises different phases, from the initial search of clients, reception and accommodation in the apartment until his departure. We also take care of the apartment all clean and conditioning time, and to resolve any issues that may arise during a guest's stay.
The main goal of our management is twofold:

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a ""friend"" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city. 
All this expertise  has allowed us to grow gradually, as the viral marketing has proven to be our best advertising tool, and thus many customers and many others have repeated recommend us to their family and friends.

We like to go over our city and to experiment it without stopping! We are passionate about architecture and design: we are Technical Architects. We work in Architectural Heritage Restoration, so we can help you and advise on everything that you may need for your tourist sightseeing! And we really love meeting people!

We have each lived in Barcelona for decades. We will gladly render advice on anything you might wish to do-whether it is holiday, touring, food or for your business-related travel needs. Our mission is to enhance (or simplify) our guests' experience in an way possible. You need only ask. In sum, we strive to provide a better experience than any five star hotel. That includes complete privacy, but a nicer, homier place to stay. If there is anything that we can do, share about living or working in BCN, please do not hesitate to ask. Our hosting style is to treat visitors as though they were good friends who have never been here, to maximize your time here. We are glad to organize anything that is of particular interest. If anything is less than perfect, we will run, possibly literally, to resolve it. Alternatively, if you prefer, we can have minimal contact, communicate in writing...or through your agent, manager or personal assistant: great. You're the guest. We will gladly share our favorite quirky haunts and eateries, things you might miss if you do not have access to an insider's view.
We love our home, neighborhood and our guests. The hosting experience: meeting new people, from all over, has been awesome.

Si bien mi pareja y mi familia, son por supuesto importantes para mí, puedo decirte que mi piso y mi huerto son dos de las cosas más importantes en mi vida, donde se refleja toda mi personalidad, clásica para muchos y poco convencional para la mayoría.  

No me apasiona viajar como turista, si integrarme en otra ciudad como uno más en una actividad profesional pues he viajado mucho por trabajo.

Sí me apasiona acoger...

Cuando de niña, en el colegio había una nueva compañera, mi pasión era recibirla, enseñarle el colegio, explicarle los detalles que necesitaba, hasta que la nueva compañera encontraba sus nuevas amigas y yo seguía con las mías... 

Ya de mayor... desde siempre compartí mi piso, procurando que siempre, todos los compañeros de piso estuvieran lo mejor posible.  

Puedo decir de mis compañeros de piso, que han aportado bonitas cosas y otros fueron complicados... pero en general he tenido una buena relación con ellos.  Todos nos hemos caracterizado por lo que yo llamo... ""el  saber hacer y saber estar"" en piso compartido.. Principalmente de esos periodos recuerdo LAAARGAS tertulias de noche, casi nunca se encendía la televisión.    

Ahora mi piso empieza una nueva etapa, lo hemos actualizado y hemos hecho algo que nos ha apasionado, hemos recuperado el suelo de mosaico hidraulico origina y por tanto refleja más que nunca la verdadera intención del arquitecto al construirse....

Podrás disfrutar de lo que yo disfruto de él, su luz incluso en días de lluvia, las vistas al cielo, a la sagrada familia, a las copas de los árboles y lo que en casa llamamos el ""petit Paris"" las buhardillas de algunos edificios al otro lado del parque. 

En definitiva, podrás disfrutar de lo más grande que yo tengo... mi pequeño, coqueto y gran piso.

We have fallen in love with Barcelona its lifestyle, people and of course the sunny weather! Luckily, we discovered this modern loft in Poblenou, which is near the beach, a short walk to small shops, a local market hall, and many boutique cafes.  
Every now and then, we spend some time here.

I studied economics and I taught it for 7 seven years.

I like to launch projects whatever the schedule or the magnitude of the challenge. I've involved in a tech start-up company called Airplane Solutions and now I've started two projects more.

I have travelled around Europe and the landscape that I liked most was that of Norway. It's a shame that this country is so expensive! When I stayed in the USA I loved Chicago as a city and the Death Valley as a landscape.

I have a background in Security and HSE, where I have been managing the security for multinational companies, and luxury hotels and international convention centers, where I could apply my hospitality with my guests.
As hobbies, I like history, architecture, cinema, computers, electronics, chess and sports, and above all meeting people from all around the world and showing them my hospitality! .

I have been hosting for years at Airbnb (I am Superhost), Tripadvisor (awarded the Certificate of Excellence), and others (I hold the ""V-R-B-O stayed here"" sticker),  and probably I am number one in reviews in Barcelona!. I advice using  Airbnb!! .

I am also father of three, and love children, you will get my suggestions of where to go with them, and also the area is perfect for them, with lots of children playgrounds around, on in same building garden. 

You should choose me because the apartment is perfect, the area lovely, and I am passionate about what I do. First of all I am a local, born and raised up in Barcelona, I know deeply the history and architectury of the city, and if you check the AMAZING reviews I have had for years, you will confirm that I do what no other people do: I take the time to meet you on arrival and provide you all the information you need during your stay from the beginning, adapting to the number of days you spend in the city. 

This includes an explanation on the neighborhood (supermarkets, restaurants, public transport, how to manage garbage...), the apartment itself (appliances, TV with international channels, heating, air conditioning...), and the city (what you cannot miss, what to get tickets for...), I also will send you (Hidden by Airbnb) maps links with my recommendations, and routes!. 
You will have the tools so you can choose what to visit to make your stay perfect. 

I am REALLY 24/7 available for any emergency or doubt, as I feel responsible of my guests while they stay with me. Everything will be perfect, but what if a child felt ill in example?. There is when you see the difference between staying with me and elsewhere!!. 

I have very often reviews in all the webpages where I am advertised like ""We have been travelling all around the world in many countries and properties, and I have never found a host like David"". 

It is very hard nowadays, when people is so busy, and in the middle of a trip, that they decide to spend time in writing such long reviews as I have, because they really feel grateful to my efforts to make their stays memorable, everlasting in time. 
If this is common, it cannot be a coincidence!!! 

Just take the time to read my reviews, and the choice is clear, you cannot be wrong if you choose me. ",David,41.40392,2.21345,3.0,92.0,2022-12-02,Sant Martí,10-2013-0613,10,SANT MARTI,69.0,Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou,Carrer,PROVENÇALS,1,5,,,,,,,2,2,4.0,2.211876293,41.40213946

He tenido la suerte de conocer bastante bien a la cultura japonesa, me siento muy atraída por algunos aspectos como la música tradicional, el shakuhachi, la gastronomía o el té. 
También he tenido oportunidad de conocer un poco de cerca la cultura nórdica europea, concretamente la sueca.
Me gusta la música instrumental en la que se usan instrumentos clásicos de distintas culturas . Instrumentos como los cuencos de cuarzo, las flautas u otros de cuerda como el koto.
Me he dedicado profesionalmente a la gastronomía durante diez años y uno de mis viajes a Japón fue el que originó mi interés y dedicación a la respostería japonesa. Fuimos, junto con mi socio, pioneros en desarrollar el daifukumochi japonés en la ciudad de Barcelona, y ahora todos los restaurantes de Barcelona ofrecen este producto en sus cartas. Puedo compartir que en el año 2005, colaboramos con El Bulli en uno de sus postres para la carta de aquella temporada. Tras esos maravillosos años entregada a la gastronomía, surgió en mi relación de pareja algo que cambió mi enfoque y abrió un interés por descubrir mi persona, a un nivel interno, de introspección. Estuve retirada del mundo laboral, dejando el negocio bajo la tutela de mi socio, y me dediqué únicamente  a un trabajo profundo sobre mi persona. Tras siete años de autoinvestigación y formación en este sentido, estoy dedicándome al acompañamiento de personas en situaciones difíciles. Soy por tanto, terapeuta, concretamente terapeuta Gestalt con estudios en psicosomática clínica y bioenergética.
Si alguno de mis huéspedes, de habla hispana, desea o necesita realizar un trabajo de ser acompañado en algún proceso de su vida, estaré encantada de que me lo proponga. Es posible realizar este tipo de trabajos en mi estudio, situado cerca del apartamento. 
Pueden ser trabajos puntuales de relajación, de meditación, de yoga o de consulta hablada.

We have this property in Barcelona with airbnb, it is an official rental property registered with the town hall and it s in a great spot in the original Barcelona Eixample righthand side. (upper market)

The property  belongs  to a family company in the name of 'Joikim' , hense the name on the advert, Joikim. 98 SL  but I m Kate

 I am originally from South Wales, UK and have been living in Cataluña since 1983.   I married locally and we have our own rental  / selling agency in the very pretty village of Calella de Palafrugell on the Costa Brava .  This opened in 1963 set up by my parents in law and now run by ourselves and our children .  I speak French,  Spanish and Catalan (not on the language list for airbnb which is a shame) .  If you are looking for a two centre holiday I can give you some tips .. the Costa Brava / Emporda is a beautiful area .. If you wanted a cycling holiday too then I can point you in the right direction, with guided tours.  We are only an hour and a half from the City.

Most of our properties are in Calella de Palafrguell and Llafranc/Tamariu but we decided to buy this in Barcelona in 2010 ... initially the idea was somewhere smaller however when we found this one we were so excited as it had so many possibilites .  We completely refurbished the apartment and turned it back to front to ensure a good nights sleep by moving  the bedrooms to the rear.  The South facing living room is on Calle Mallorca, just two blocks from the Paseo de Gracia between Roger de Lluiria and Bruc streets.

I like visiting other countries and have worked abroad for many years working in the travel industry beforehand .. that is infact how I got to Calella /Barcelona in 1983.  

Personally I love this area,  it has everything going for it , cities, culture, beaches, mountains and delicious food!  I've been very lucky to be able to settle here!  I live in the countryside with my family, dogs and horse .. you ll have my contact and you ll be met by Rosi at the apartment, she speaks all the languages and is a brilliant guide to set you on your way.  Oscar the taxi driver can be arranged to meet you at the airport should you require.  We re on hand now and during your stay.

Me llamo Kate y  disponemos del apartamento en Barcelona 
La propiedad pertenecen a mi compañía familiar en nombre de Joikim, tal como está mencionado en el anuncio. 

Soy nacida en el Sur de Gales, pero llevo viviendo en Cataluña desde 1983, donde me casé. 
Tenemos una empresa familiar dedicada al alquiler/venta de propiedades en Calella de Palafrugell, un bonito pueblo en la Costa Brava, desde hace más de 50 años, la cual fue fundada por mis cuñados.

En cuanto idiomas, dominamos tanto el Inglés como el Catalán, Francés y Español. 

El apartamento de Barcelona fue comprado en 2010. Inicialmente la idea era encontrar una propiedad pequeña destinada a nuestros hijos para poder usar durante sus estudios en la ciudad, fue entonces cuando encontramos este espacioso apartamento que nos encantó por la cantidad de posibilidades que podríamos sacar de él. Lo reformamos completamente , ubicando las habitaciones a la parte trasera del edificio para garantizar la tranquilidad de noche y de manera que la sala-comedor quedase orientada al sur. 

Me encanta viajar, de hecho, he estado trabajando en el sector turístico en diferentes países durante muchos años, así fue como me instalé en Calella/Barcelona en 1983. 
Personalmente esta zona me encanta, tiene todo lo uno quisiera, ciudades, cultura, playas, montañas y buena gastronomía! Soy muy afortunada de poder  considerar este sitio mi hogar.

Em dic Kate i disposem de l'apartament a Barcelona,  pertanyen a la nostra companyia familiar en nom de Joikim, tal com està mencionat a l'anunci. 
Sóc nascuda al Sud de Gales, però visc a Catalunya des  de 1983, on em vaig casar. 
Tenim una empresa familiar dedicada al lloguer/venta de propietats a Calella de Palafruell, un preciós poble de la Costa Brava, des de fa més de 50 anys, la qual va ser fundada pels meus cunyats. 
Estem molt contents de poder llogar algunes de les nostres propietats a través de Airbnb. 
Pel que fa els idiomes, dominem tant l'anglès com el català, francès i Castellà. 

L'apartament de Barcelona va ser comprat al 2010. Inicialment la idea era trobar una petita propietat destinada als nostres fills per poder utilitzar durant els seus estudis a la ciutat, va ser aleshores quan vam trobar aquest espaiós apartament que ens va encantar per la quantitat de possibilitats que podríem treure d'ell. 
Va ser reformat completament, ubicant les habitacions a la part darrera de l'edifici per tal de garantitzar la tranquil·litat a la nit i de manera que el saló-menjador quedés en orientació Sud.

M'agrada molt viatjar, de fet, he estat treballant en el sector turístic en diferents països durant molts anys, així va ser com em vaig instal·lar a Calella/Barcelona al 1983. 
Personalment m'encanta aquesta zona, té tot el que un voldria, ciutats, cultura, platges, muntanya i bona gastronomia! Sóc molt afortunada de poder considerar aquest lloc com a la meva llar.

Ariel Bercovich. Architect, designer and photographer. 

WHY
Son of a photographer and a school teacher, self-taught, the camera has been his lifelong companion, the eye through which his perception of reality is filtered and blended.

WHAT
In his latest work, he focuses on photographing urban spaces, landscapes and architecture, though he also enjoys doing portraits and taking part in spontaneous collaborations in the world of theatre and communications.

I was born in a small town and lived in a tiny village near Frankfurt Main. I moved to England as an exchange student for my studies where I ended up staying for 18 years - now thats's a very long year to be an exchange student no? 

I tried my hands on all kinds of jobs including in the music industry and running my own massage and beauty company working with all the major London hotels for 11 years. 

I fell in love with Barcelona in April 2000. I remember it like yesterday! And then Barcelona was calling in 2009 so I relocated and I am still in love with it and the lifestyle that comes with it.

If there is one thing I can't live without then it is Tina Turner. I have been a fan of hers for over 30 years now and even had the honour to meet her once in person. 

I love exploring new cities and countries but I am also a huge fan of beautiful countrysides and nature in general. I walk a lot sometimes up to 5 hours I just can't stop sometimes. Once I walked El Camino de Santiago in Spain - some 800 km in 23 days! 

I love to meet friends for a coffee, a drink or a little dance to swing the hips from time to time.
